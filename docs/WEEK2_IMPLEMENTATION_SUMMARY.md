## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Key Design Patterns

**1. Graceful Error Handling**:
```python
try:
    # Main task logic
    result = perform_analysis()
    logger.info("‚úÖ Task complete")
    return {"status": "success", "data": result}
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"‚ùå Task failed: {e}")
    return {"status": "error", "error": str(e)}
```

**2. JSON Parsing with Fallbacks**:
```python
try:
    # Try direct JSON parse
    data = json.loads(response)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    # Try extracting from markdown code block
    json_match = re.search(r'```(?:json)?\s*(\{.*?\})\s*```', response, re.DOTALL)
    if json_match:
        data = json.loads(json_match.group(1))
    else:
        # Fallback to raw response
        data = {'raw_response': response, 'parsed': False}
```

**3. Contextual Data Loading**:
```python
# Load overnight research if available
overnight_research = {}
research_file = Path('logs/overnight_analysis.json')
if research_file.exists():
    with open(research_file, 'r') as f:
        all_research = json.load(f)
        # Get most recent for each symbol
        for symbol in self.agent.symbols:
            symbol_research = [r for r in all_research if r.get('symbol') == symbol]
            if symbol_research:
                overnight_research[symbol] = symbol_research[-1]
```

**4. Comprehensive Logging**:
```python
log_entry = {
    'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
    'task': 'task_name',
    'input_data': {...},
    'llm_response': {...},
    'metadata': {...}
}

with open('logs/task_name.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(log_entry) + '\n')
```

### Dependencies Used
- `datetime`, `timedelta` - Time calculations
- `json` - Data serialization
- `pathlib.Path` - File operations
- `loguru.logger` - Structured logging
- `re` - Regex for parsing
- `numpy` - Statistical calculations (volatility, returns)

## üìà Success Metrics

Track these weekly to measure impact:

### 1. Morning Briefing Usage
```python
# Check logs/overnight_summary.jsonl
briefings = load_jsonl('logs/overnight_summary.jsonl')

# Metrics
avg_sentiment_score = mean([b['summary']['sentiment_score'] for b in briefings])
high_priority_per_day = mean([len([s for s in b['summary']['watchlist_insights'] if s['priority'] == 'HIGH']) for b in briefings])
strategy_distribution = Counter([b['summary']['overall_strategy'] for b in briefings])

print(f"Avg Sentiment: {avg_sentiment_score}/100")
print(f"High Priority Stocks/Day: {high_priority_per_day}")
print(f"Strategy Distribution: {strategy_distribution}")
```

**Targets**:
- Sentiment score accuracy: >70% correct prediction
- High priority stocks: 2-4 per day
- Strategy distribution: Balanced across AGGRESSIVE/NORMAL/CAUTIOUS

### 2. Gap Opportunities Win Rate
```python
# Check logs/premarket_scanner.jsonl
scans = load_jsonl('logs/premarket_scanner.jsonl')

# Track which opportunities were actually taken
# Compare predicted win_probability vs actual outcomes
opportunities = [o for scan in scans for o in scan['opportunities']['top_opportunities']]

predicted_win_rate = mean([o['win_probability'] for o in opportunities])
actual_win_rate = calculate_actual_outcomes(opportunities)

print(f"Predicted: {predicted_win_rate}%")
print(f"Actual: {actual_win_rate}%")
print(f"Calibration Error: {abs(predicted_win_rate - actual_win_rate)}%")
```

**Targets**:
- Calibration error <10%
- Top opportunities have >60% win rate
- Risk/reward ratio >2:1 average

### 3. Earnings Strategy Effectiveness
```python
# Check logs/earnings_analysis.jsonl
analyses = load_jsonl('logs/earnings_analysis.jsonl')

# Track outcomes of earnings strategies
strategies = [s for analysis in analyses for s in analysis['analysis']['earnings_strategies']]

# Compare recommended actions vs actual outcomes
close_before_wins = calculate_strategy_wins('CLOSE_BEFORE')
hold_through_wins = calculate_strategy_wins('HOLD_THROUGH')

print(f"CLOSE_BEFORE Win Rate: {close_before_wins}%")
print(f"HOLD_THROUGH Win Rate: {hold_through_wins}%")
```

**Targets**:
- CLOSE_BEFORE reduces >70% of earnings-related losses
- HOLD_THROUGH wins >50% of the time
- Portfolio adjustments reduce overall volatility by 20%

### 4. LLM Query Efficiency
```python
# From llm_conversations.jsonl
conversations = load_jsonl('logs/llm_conversations.jsonl')

# Filter for new tasks
morning_tasks = ['OVERNIGHT_SUMMARY', 'PREMARKET_SCANNER', 'EARNINGS_ANALYSIS']
task_conversations = [c for c in conversations if c['symbol'] in morning_tasks]

avg_response_time = mean([c['response_time'] for c in task_conversations])
avg_tokens = mean([c['tokens_used'] for c in task_conversations])

print(f"Avg Response Time: {avg_response_time}s")
print(f"Avg Tokens Used: {avg_tokens}")
```

**Targets**:
- Response time <30 seconds per task
- Total morning tasks complete in <2 minutes
- Token usage efficient (<2000 tokens per task)

## üîÑ How It Works

### During Trading (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM)
```python
# Every trading decision is automatically recorded
decision_id = learning_engine.record_decision(
    symbol='AAPL',
    action='buy',
    price=175.50,
    shares=10,
    technical_indicators={'rsi': 65, 'macd': 1.2},
    llm_analysis={'sentiment': 'bullish', 'confidence': 0.75},
    decision_confidence=0.80,
    decision_reasoning='Technical + LLM alignment'
)

# Market context is captured automatically:
# - Regime: bull/bear/sideways/volatile
# - VIX level and trend
# - Sector momentum
# - Time of day
# - Days until OPEX
# - etc.
```

### When Position Closes
```python
# Outcome is recorded for learning
learning_engine.record_outcome(
    decision_id=decision_id,
    outcome='win',  # or 'loss' or 'neutral'
    profit_loss=125.50,
    exit_price=178.25,
    exit_time=datetime.now(),
    lesson_learned='Morning breakout pattern worked'
)
```

### Evening Learning (4:30 PM)
```python
# Scheduled task runs automatically:
# 1. Analyzes today's performance
performance = learning_engine.analyze_daily_performance()
# Result: Win rate, P&L, lessons learned

# 2. Discovers patterns from last 30 days
patterns = learning_engine.discover_patterns(lookback_days=30)
# Result: Profitable setups (time-based, regime-based, etc.)

# 3. Generates insights for tomorrow
# Result: Which patterns to apply, what to avoid
```

### Next Day (Morning)
```python
# System loads learned patterns
patterns = learning_engine.memory.get_patterns(min_success_rate=0.6)

# When analyzing a trade:
# - Check if it matches a known winning pattern
# - Increase confidence if pattern match found
# - Avoid setups that historically lose
```

## üíæ Data Stored

### For Each Decision:
- **Timestamp** and **Symbol**
- **Action** (buy/sell/hold) and **Price**
- **Market Context**: Regime, VIX, sectors, time, etc.
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, volume, etc.
- **LLM Analysis**: Sentiment, confidence, reasoning
- **Decision Confidence** and **Reasoning**
- **Outcome**: Win/loss/neutral, P&L, duration
- **Lesson Learned**: What worked/didn't work

### Patterns Discovered:
- **Pattern Name** and **Type**
- **Conditions**: When does this pattern appear?
- **Success Rate**: Historical win percentage
- **Sample Size**: Number of occurrences
- **Average Return**: Expected profit
- **Risk/Reward Ratio**

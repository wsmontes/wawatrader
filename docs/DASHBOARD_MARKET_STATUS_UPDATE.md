# Dashboard Market Status Update

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

## What Was Added

### Market Status Display in Dashboard Header

The dashboard now displays **real-time market status** and **intelligent state** in the header bar.

### Visual Changes

**Before:**
```
[🤖 WawaTrader Beta]    [LIVE] [Time] [P&L] [⚙️ Config]
```

**After:**
```
[🤖 WawaTrader Beta]    [LIVE] [🟢 OPEN] [🟢 Active Trading] [Time] [P&L] [⚙️ Config]
                                     ↑              ↑
                              Market Status   Market State
```

### Status Badge Features

#### 1. **Market Status Badge**
Shows whether market is open or closed:
- **🟢 OPEN** - Green background with pulsing animation
- **🔴 CLOSED** - Red background
- Updates every refresh (30 seconds)

#### 2. **Market State Badge** (New!)
Shows current intelligent scheduling state:
- **🟢 Active Trading** (9:30 AM - 3:30 PM)
- **🟡 Market Closing** (3:30 PM - 4:30 PM)
- **🔴 Evening Analysis** (4:30 PM - 10:00 PM)
- **💤 Overnight Sleep** (10:00 PM - 6:00 AM)
- **🌅 Pre-Market Prep** (6:00 AM - 9:30 AM)

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `wawatrader/dashboard.py`

#### 1. Added Two New Status Badges
```python
html.Div(id="market-status", className="status-badge"),  # Market open/closed
html.Div(id="market-state", className="status-badge"),   # Intelligent state
```

#### 2. Enhanced Header Callback
Updated `update_header()` callback to fetch and display:
- Market status from Alpaca API
- Market state from intelligent scheduler
- Dynamic styling based on open/closed status
- Pulsing animation when market is open

#### 3. Added CSS Animation
```css
@keyframes pulse {
    0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
    50% { opacity: 0.7; }
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Every 30 seconds** (main-interval):
   - Dashboard calls `alpaca.get_market_status()`
   - Gets current market state from `get_market_state()`
   - Updates both status badges
   - Applies appropriate styling

2. **When Market is OPEN**:
   - Status badge: **🟢 OPEN** (green, pulsing)
   - State badge: Shows current trading state
   - Users know system is actively trading

3. **When Market is CLOSED**:
   - Status badge: **🔴 CLOSED** (red, solid)
   - State badge: Shows current intelligent state
   - Users know what system is doing during off-hours

### User Benefits

✅ **Immediate Visual Clarity** - No confusion about market status  
✅ **Intelligent State Awareness** - See what the system is doing  
✅ **Time Management** - Know when to expect trading activity  
✅ **Professional Look** - Matches Bloomberg/TradingView standards  

### Testing

Verified with demo script:
```bash
venv/bin/python scripts/demo_market_status_dashboard.py
```

**Results**:
```
✅ Market Status Badge: 🔴 CLOSED
✅ Color: RED (as expected)
✅ Market State Badge: 💤 Overnight Sleep
✅ All badges displaying correctly
```

### To See It Live

```bash
python start.py dashboard
# Opens at http://localhost:8050
```

The header will show:
1. **LIVE** - System is running
2. **🔴 CLOSED** (or **🟢 OPEN**) - Market status
3. **💤 Overnight Sleep** (or current state) - Intelligent scheduler state
4. **Current time** - System clock
5. **P&L** - Today's profit/loss
6. **Config** - Settings button

### Files Modified

```
wawatrader/
└── dashboard.py          [MODIFIED - Added market status display]

### Integration with Intelligent Scheduling

The dashboard now **fully integrates** with the intelligent scheduling system:

- Shows when system is in **Active Trading** mode
- Displays **Evening Analysis** status
- Indicates **Overnight Sleep** mode
- Shows **Pre-Market Prep** activity

Users can now **visually see** that the system adapts its behavior based on market hours!

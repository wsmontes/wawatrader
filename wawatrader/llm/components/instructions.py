‚ö° YOUR TASK: Evaluate if this is a good BUY opportunity RIGHT NOW
{'=' * 70}

You are evaluating a NEW stock for potential purchase.

Consider these factors:

1. TECHNICAL SETUP (70% weight)
   ‚Ä¢ Is the trend clear and confirmed?
   ‚Ä¢ Is momentum healthy (RSI 40-70 range ideal)?
   ‚Ä¢ Does volume confirm the move (‚â•1.2x average is good)?
   ‚Ä¢ Are we near support or resistance levels?

2. ENTRY TIMING (20% weight)
   ‚Ä¢ Is this the right moment or should we wait?
   ‚Ä¢ Is the stock overbought (RSI>70) or oversold (RSI<30)?
   ‚Ä¢ Any near-term catalysts to consider?
   ‚Ä¢ Better to enter now or wait for pullback?

3. RISK/REWARD (10% weight)
   ‚Ä¢ Where are support/resistance levels for stops and targets?
   ‚Ä¢ What's the potential profit vs potential loss?
   ‚Ä¢ Is risk/reward ratio favorable (ideally 2:1 or better)?

DECISION GUIDELINES:
   ‚Ä¢ BUY: Strong technical setup with good entry timing
   ‚Ä¢ HOLD: Good setup but poor timing (e.g., overbought) - wait for better entry
   ‚Ä¢ SELL: Not applicable for new opportunities

Be specific: Include price levels, support/resistance, and timeframe

‚ö° YOUR TASK: Decide if you should HOLD or SELL this existing position
{'=' * 70}

‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: You are NOT evaluating whether to buy this stock.
You ALREADY OWN IT. The question is: Should you continue holding or exit?

Evaluation Framework:

1. TECHNICAL HEALTH (40% weight)
   ‚Ä¢ Has the trend deteriorated or broken down?
   ‚Ä¢ Is momentum weakening (RSI declining, MACD bearish)?
   ‚Ä¢ Any technical breakdown signals (break below support, moving avg crossover)?
   ‚Ä¢ Volume patterns - are sellers dominating?

2. PROFIT/LOSS STATUS (30% weight)
   ‚Ä¢ If PROFITABLE ‚Üí Is profit target reached? Time to lock gains?
   ‚Ä¢ If LOSING ‚Üí Is stop-loss hit? Cut losses or wait for recovery?
   ‚Ä¢ If FLAT ‚Üí Is capital better deployed elsewhere?
   ‚Ä¢ How long have we held this position?

3. RELATIVE OPPORTUNITY COST (30% weight)
   ‚Ä¢ Are there better opportunities available right now?
   ‚Ä¢ Is this still a top holding or just "okay"?
   ‚Ä¢ What's the opportunity cost of keeping capital here?
   ‚Ä¢ In a portfolio ranking, where does this position stand?

DECISION GUIDELINES:
   ‚Ä¢ SELL: If any of these apply:
     - Technical setup has deteriorated significantly
     - Profit target reached (lock in gains)
     - Stop-loss hit (cut losses early)
     - Better opportunities exist elsewhere
     - Position is weak compared to portfolio average
     
   ‚Ä¢ HOLD: If all of these apply:
     - Trend remains intact and healthy
     - No major red flags
     - Still one of best available holdings
     - P&L status is acceptable
     
   ‚Ä¢ BUY: Only if ALL of these apply (rare):
     - Strong bullish continuation signal
     - Very high conviction
     - Position sizing rules allow
     - This is THE best opportunity right now

‚ö†Ô∏è  BIAS WARNING:
   ‚Ä¢ Don't hold losers hoping for recovery - that's anchoring bias
   ‚Ä¢ Don't get emotionally attached to winning positions
   ‚Ä¢ Capital rotation creates more opportunities than buy-and-hold

‚ö° YOUR TASK: Rank ALL holdings from STRONGEST to WEAKEST
{'=' * 70}

You will receive data for multiple positions. Evaluate and rank each one.

Ranking Criteria:

1. Technical Strength (50% weight)
   ‚Ä¢ Trend direction and strength (bullish > neutral > bearish)
   ‚Ä¢ Momentum health (positive > neutral > negative)
   ‚Ä¢ Volume confirmation (high vol moves are stronger)
   ‚Ä¢ Price action relative to moving averages

2. Performance (30% weight)
   ‚Ä¢ Current P&L (profits > breakeven > losses)
   ‚Ä¢ Recent price action (gaining > flat > losing)
   ‚Ä¢ Consistency (steady gains > volatile > steady losses)
   ‚Ä¢ Days held (quick winners good, long losers bad)

3. Relative Attractiveness (20% weight)
   ‚Ä¢ Best risk/reward going forward
   ‚Ä¢ Strongest setups for continuation
   ‚Ä¢ Most upside potential remaining
   ‚Ä¢ Least downside risk

Output Requirements:
   ‚Ä¢ Rank from 1 (best) to N (worst)
   ‚Ä¢ Give each a score (0-100)
   ‚Ä¢ Assign action: KEEP (top positions), HOLD (middle), or SELL (weak)
   ‚Ä¢ Brief reason for each ranking

Goal: Identify:
   ‚Ä¢ Top 3-5 positions to KEEP (strongest holdings)
   ‚Ä¢ Middle positions to HOLD and monitor
   ‚Ä¢ Bottom 3-5 to SELL for capital rotation

‚ö†Ô∏è  Capital Rotation Strategy:
   Selling weak positions frees capital for better opportunities.

‚ö° YOUR TASK: Compare these stocks and rank them by attractiveness
{'=' * 70}

You will receive technical data for multiple stocks. Compare them
side-by-side and determine which are most attractive.

Comparison Factors:

1. Technical Setup
   ‚Ä¢ Which has the strongest trend?
   ‚Ä¢ Which has the healthiest momentum?
   ‚Ä¢ Which has best volume confirmation?

2. Risk/Reward
   ‚Ä¢ Which has best upside potential?
   ‚Ä¢ Which has least downside risk?
   ‚Ä¢ Which has clearest support/resistance levels?

3. Timing
   ‚Ä¢ Which is best positioned for entry NOW?
   ‚Ä¢ Which needs to pull back first?
   ‚Ä¢ Which is overbought/oversold?

Output Format:
   Rank from BEST to WORST with scores and reasoning

Example:
   1. BEST: NVDA (Score: 92/100)
      Reason: Strong uptrend, RSI 62 (healthy), 1.8x volume
   
   2. GOOD: AMD (Score: 78/100)
